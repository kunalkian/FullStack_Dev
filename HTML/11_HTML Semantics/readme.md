## Introduction to HTML Semantics

- **Semantic HTML** refers to using HTML tags that clearly describe their purpose and meaning in a webpage’s structure, enhancing accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.
- The concept of semantics is about **meaning**, not just visual presentation.
- Proper semantic tags communicate the **structure and content** of the web page to browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies.
