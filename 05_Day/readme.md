## SEO, Core Web Vitals, and Meta Tags in HTML

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
SEO refers to the practice of optimizing web pages to improve their visibility and ranking in search engine results. Good SEO helps attract more organic (non-paid) traffic to your website.

### Core Web Vitals
Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics defined by Google to measure user experience on the web. They focus on three main aspects:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures loading performance. Aim for LCP to occur within 2.5 seconds.
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Measures interactivity. Aim for FID of less than 100 milliseconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures visual stability. Aim for a CLS score of less than 0.1.

Optimizing these metrics can improve both user experience and search rankings.

### Meta Tags and Meta Description in HTML
Meta tags provide metadata about your web page to search engines and browsers. The most important meta tags for SEO include:

```html
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A brief summary of your page content for search engines and users.">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Other meta tags -->
</head>
```

- **Meta Description:** The `description` meta tag summarizes the page content. It often appears in search results and can influence click-through rates.
- **Title Tag:** The `<title>` tag defines the page title shown in browser tabs and search results.

Using relevant meta tags and optimizing for Core Web Vitals are essential steps for effective SEO.
